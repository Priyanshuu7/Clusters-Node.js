**Cluster and Load Balancing**

- **Introduction to Clusters**: Clusters are groups of processes that can be used to run multiple instances of applications. They help in distributing workloads among application threads, which is crucial for scaling applications effectively .

- **Problem of Increasing Load**: As the number of users increases, a single server can become overloaded, leading to performance issues such as increased response times or server crashes .

- **Solution with Clustering**: By implementing a cluster architecture, multiple worker processes can be spawned to handle incoming requests. This allows for better distribution of workloads and prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck .

- **Architecture Overview**: 
  - A primary server manages the distribution of requests to multiple worker servers.
  - Each worker processes requests independently, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance .

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. **Set Up Express Server**: Start with a simple Express server that listens for requests .
  2. **Import Clustering Module**: Use the built-in cluster module to create multiple worker instances based on the number of CPU cores available .
  3. **Load Balancing**: Implement a round-robin approach to distribute incoming requests evenly across the worker processes .

- **Load Distribution Algorithm**: The default algorithm for distributing requests is the round-robin method, where each worker is assigned requests in a cyclic manner. This helps in balancing the load effectively and preventing any single worker from being overwhelmed .

- **Benefits of Clustering**:
  - Improved handling of concurrent users.
  - Enhanced application performance through load balancing.
  - Increased reliability by distributing workloads among multiple processes .

- **Conclusion**: Clustering is a vital technique for scaling applications and managing high loads efficiently. By distributing workloads among multiple worker processes, applications can handle increased traffic without compromising performance .
